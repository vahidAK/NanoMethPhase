                        Base quality that SNVs tagged to a haplotype shoud
                        have compare to the other haplotype. When the average
                        base quality of SNVs mapped to two haplotype for one
                        read is equal or decision cannot be made Base on
                        Average bq (e.g. when 10 SNVs of HP1 mapped to a read
                        with average quality of 30, but only one SNV from HP2
                        mapped to the same read with bq=35) Then, instead of

                        them comma seperates (e.g. file1,file2,file3)
  --control CONTROL, -co CONTROL
                        The path to the tab delimited input methylation
                        frequency or ready input control file(s). If multiple

                        The path to the output directory
  --out_prefix OUT_PREFIX, -op OUT_PREFIX
                        The prefix for the output files

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --columns COLUMNS, -c COLUMNS
                        Comma seperated Columns in the methylation frequency
                        files that include the following information,
                        respectively: chromosome start strand coverage
                        methylation_frequency. If the methylation frequency
                        file does not have strand level information then just
                        enter columns number for chromosome start coverage
                        methylation_frequency. Default is that your input
                        files are already in a format required by DSS so you
                        do not need to select any column. If you giving as
                        input NanoMethPhase frequency files select
                        this:--columns 1,2,4,5,7
  --Rscript RSCRIPT, -rs RSCRIPT
                        The path to a particular instance of Rscript to use
  --script_file SCRIPT_FILE, -sf SCRIPT_FILE
                        The path to the DSS_DMA.R script file
  --coverage COVERAGE, -cov COVERAGE
                        Coverage cutoff. Default is >=1. It is recommended
                        that do not filter for coverage as DSS R package will
                        take care of it.
  --dis_merge DIS_MERGE, -dm DIS_MERGE
                        When two DMRs are very close to each other and the
                        distance (in bps) is less than this number, they will
                        be merged into one. Default is 1500 bps.
  --minlen MINLEN, -ml MINLEN
                        Minimum length (in basepairs) required for DMR.
                        Default is 100 bps.
  --minCG MINCG, -mcg MINCG
                        Minimum number of CpG sites required for DMR. Default
                        is 15.
  --smoothing_span SMOOTHING_SPAN, -sms SMOOTHING_SPAN
                        The size of smoothing window, in basepairs. Default is
                        500.
  --smoothing_flag SMOOTHING_FLAG, -smf SMOOTHING_FLAG
                        TRUE/FALSE. The size of smoothing window, in
                        basepairs. Default is TRUE. We recommend to use
                        smoothing=TRUE for whole-genome BS-seq data, and
                        smoothing=FALSE for sparser data such like from RRBS
                        or hydroxyl-methylation data (TAB-seq). If there is
                        not biological replicate, smoothing=TRUE is required.
                        Default is TRUE
  --equal_disp EQUAL_DISP, -ed EQUAL_DISP
                        TRUE/FALSE. When there is no biological replicate in
                        one or both treatment groups, users can either (1)
                        specify equal.disp=TRUE, which assumes both groups
                        have the same dispersion, then the data from two
                        groups are combined and used as replicates to estimate
                        dispersion; or (2) specify smoothing=TRUE, which uses
                        the smoothed means (methylation levels) to estimate
                        dispersions via a shrinkage estimator. This smoothing
                        procedure uses data from neighboring CpG sites as
                        "pseudo-replicate" for estimating biological variance.
                        Default is FALSE
  --pval_cutoff PVAL_CUTOFF, -pvc PVAL_CUTOFF
                        A threshold of p-values for calling DMR. Loci with
                        p-values less than this threshold will be picked and
                        joint to form the DMRs. See 'details' for more
                        information. Default is 0.001
  --delta_cutoff DELTA_CUTOFF, -dc DELTA_CUTOFF
                        A threshold for defining DMR. In DML detection
                        procedure, a hypothesis test that the two groups means
                        are equal is conducted at each CpG site. Here if
                        'delta' is specified, the function will compute the
                        posterior probability that the difference of the means
                        are greater than delta, and then construct DMR based
                        on that. This only works when the test results are
                        from 'DMLtest', which is for two-group comparison.
                        Default is 0
  --pct_sig PCT_SIG, -pct PCT_SIG
                        In all DMRs, the percentage of CG sites with
                        significant p-values (less than p.threshold) must be
                        greater than this threshold. Default is 0.5. This is
                        mainly used for correcting the effects of merging of
                        nearby DMRs.

# Quickstart

If you have your methylation call data and phased vcf file you can get the
haplotype methylome via:

**1- Processing and indexing methylation call file**

```
nanomethphase methyl_call_processor -mc MethylationCall.tsv -t 20 | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n -k3,3n | bgzip > MethylationCall.bed.gz && tabix -p bed MethylationCall.bed.gz
```

**2- Getting haplotype methylome:**

```
nanomethphase  phase -mc MethylationCall.bed.gz -o Test_methylome -of bam,methylcall,bam2bis -b sorted.bam -r hg38.fa -v Phased.vcf -t 64
```

You can select 3 output options:

***bam***: output phased bam files

***methylcall***: this will output phased methylation call (MethylCall.tsv, read level data) and methylation frequency files (MethylFrequency.tsv, Aggregated methylations for each region. These files can be used to detect differentially methylated regions between haplotype using *dma* module.). The headers for methylation call files are as follow:

| **Shorten**   | **Description** |
| ------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| chromosome    | Chromosome name.                                                  |

| **Shorten**             | **Description** |
| ----------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Having this file allow you to use it instead of the vcf file which improves the speed significantly for future runs, for example when you wish to phase with different threshols etc.  
  
  
**NOTE:** Currently, NanoMethPhase requires a single sample vcf file in which phase information of SNVs in 10th column indicated by "|" (e.g. 0|1 or 1|0). For more information about the input vcf file please read issue [#1](https://github.com/vahidAK/NanoMethPhase/issues/1)  
  
**3- Getting differentially methylated regions between haplotypes:**  

```
nanomethphase dma -c 1,2,4,5,7 -ca <path to methylation frequency for haplotype1> -co <path to methylation frequency for haplotype2> -o <output directory> -op <output Prefix>
```

We use [DSS](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DSS.html) R/Bioconductor package to call DMRs between haplotypes.
callDMR.txt is the main output you need that stores differentially methylated regions, callDML.txt is the output that stores differentialy methylated loci and DMLtest.txt is the output that stores statistical test results for all loci. For more documentation of output data refere to [DSS](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DSS.html) page.  

# Full Tutorial

In order to get the phased methylome you also need the following third-party
software:

[Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish) : To call CpG methylation.

[Clair](https://github.com/HKU-BAL/Clair) or other variant callers: To call
variants for your sample. Alternatively, you might already have variant calling
data for example from Illumina sequencing.

[WhatsHap](https://github.com/whatshap/whatshap): To phase single nucleotide
variants.

## 1- Methylation Calling

### 1-1 indexing fastq file and fast5 files:

NOTE: Fastqs must be merged to a single file

```
nanopolish index -d /path/to/fast5s_directory/.fastq
```

### 1-2 Methylation calling for CpG from each read:

```
nanopolish call-methylation -t <number_of_threads> -q cpg -r /path/to/fastq_fromstep-1/fastq.fastq -b /path/to/sorted_and_indexed/bam.bam -g /path/to/reference.fa > /path/to/MethylationCall.tsv
```

For the full tutorial please refer to
[Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish) page on GitHub.

## 2- Variant Calling

We have used Clair to call variants. However, you may call variants with other
tools or your variant data may come from Illumina or other methods.

You can call variants for each chromosome using the following command and then
concatenate all files:

```
for i in chr{1..22} chrX chrY; do callVarBam --chkpnt_fn <path_to_model_file> --ref_fn <reference_genome.fa> --bam_fn <sorted_indexed.bam> --ctgName $i --sampleName <your_sample_name> --call_fn $i".vcf" --threshold 0.2 --samtools <path_to_executable_samtools_software> --pypy <path_to_executable_pypy > --threads <number_of_threads>
```

For the full tutorial please refer to [Clair](https://github.com/HKU-BAL/Clair)
page on GitHub.

After variant calling, you can select only SNVs which will be used for phasing:
```
awk '$4 != "." && $5 != "." && length($4) == 1 && length($5) == 1 && $6 > <the_variant_calling_quality_threshold>' variants.vcf > HighQualitySNVs.vcf
```

If you are calling variants from low coverage nanopore data (<30x) using Clair, you can also use our other tool [SNVoter](https://github.com/vahidAK/SNVoter) to improve SNV detection.

## 3- Phasing of detected SNVs

If you have your SNVs data available you need to phase them using
[WhatsHap](https://github.com/whatshap/whatshap).

```
whatshap phase --ignore-read-groups --reference reference.fa -o HighQualitySNVs_whatshap_phased.vcf HighQualitySNVs.vcf sorted_indexed.bam
```

For the full tutorial please refer to
[WhatsHap](https://github.com/whatshap/whatshap) page on GitHub.

If you have Trio data (Father, Mother, Child) you can use the script
[Trio_To_PhaseVCF_4FemaleChild.sh](https://github.com/vahidAK/NanoMethPhase/tree/master/scripts)
or
[Trio_To_PhaseVCF_4MaleChild.sh](https://github.com/vahidAK/NanoMethPhase/tree/master/scripts)
script to make a mock phased vcf file and use it as input for NanoMethPhase.

  
**NOTE:** Currently, NanoMethPhase requires a single sample vcf file in which phase information of SNVs in 10th column indicated by "|" (e.g. 0|1 or 1|0). For more information about the input vcf file please read issue [#1](https://github.com/vahidAK/NanoMethPhase/issues/1).  
## 4- Detecting Haplotype Methylome

### 4-1 First you need to phase process methylation call file from Nanopolish.

```
nanomethphase methyl_call_processor -mc MethylationCall.tsv -t 20 | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n -k3,3n | bgzip > MethylationCall.bed.gz && tabix -p bed MethylationCall.bed.gz
```

### 4-2 Getting haplotype methylome:

```
nanomethphase  phase -mc MethylationCall.bed.gz -o Test_methylome -of bam,methylcall,bam2bis -b sorted.bam -r hg38.fa -v Phased.vcf -t 64
```

If your are not using called SNVs from nanopore data, and they come from, for
example, short-read sequencing, we recommend using -mbq 0 in the above code.

You can select 3 output options:

***bam***: output phased bam files

***methylcall***: this will output phased methylation call (MethylCall.tsv, read level data) and methylation frequency files (MethylFrequency.tsv, Aggregated methylations for each region.

### 4-3 Differential Methylation Analysis:

```
nanomethphase dma -c 1,2,4,5,7 -ca <path to methylation frequency for haplotype1> -co <path to methylation frequency for haplotype2> -o <output directory> -op <output Prefix>
```

We use [DSS](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DSS.html) R/Bioconductor package to call DMRs between haplotypes.
callDMR.txt is the main output you need that stores differentially methylated regions, callDML.txt is the output that stores differentialy methylated loci and DMLtest.txt is the output that stores statistical test results for all loci. For more documentation of output data refere to [DSS](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DSS.html) page.

# Example:
We have included an example data in the Example_Data folder which you can use for a quick detection of haplotype methylome on 1Mb of chr21.  
If you want to try workflow from basecalling to methylation phasing we have included a subset of NA12878 data (chr11:1000000-3000000) at [this link](https://www.bcgsc.ca/downloads/NanoMethPhase/test_data.tar.gz) which you can download and try.
